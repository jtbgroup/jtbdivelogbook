Jt'B Dive logbook
=================
This software is an electronic dive logbook that allows you to register basic informations about dives. 

It's based on own needs but can "easily" be extended with new features. 

Please don't hesitate to report bugs, ask new features or participate to the project.

Requirements
------------
* Java 1.6 minimum 
* Tested on Linux (Ubuntu) and a little bit on Windows Vista... 

How to
------
Just unzip the archive where you want and execute the appropriate "run" file.

for linux: don't forget to allow execute on the run.sh file
for windows: it seems not to work when executing run.cmd from C:\Program Files\... If you encounter this problem, choose another location to unzip the archive

Toubleshooting
--------------
* Sinds version 2.6.0, Linux users may encounter jvm problems when using the maps (SIGSEGV). The problem doesn't occur when using the openjdk 7.
